# ðŸ§  Predicting Airfoil Self-Noise using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict **aerodynamic noise (in decibels)** generated by airfoils based on flow and geometric conditions. The goal is to identify key factors influencing noise and build accurate regression models for aerospace R&D use cases.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

Develop and compare ML models (Linear, Ridge, Random Forest, XGBoost) on the [UCI Airfoil Self-Noise Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Airfoil+Self-Noise), and extract insights about which physical parameters contribute most to airfoil-generated sound pressure levels.
